A quick and easy website showcasing a responsive layout complete with a "Home", "Portfolio" and "Contact" buttons.
  - The Home page features a responsive image that scales the size of the image to the users interface.
  - The Portfolio page featured a hyperlink to my github repositories page.
  - The Contact page includes my personal contact information, as well as a hyper-link to my social media profile on Linkedin.
